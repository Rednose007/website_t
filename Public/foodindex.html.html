    <h1>Best food in bhutan</h1>
<h3>Top 3 you must try</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Sikam paa</h4>
<p>The Pork belly are smoked and dried in the Sun for a good amount of time even extending to couple of days. the dried pork belly is then is fried up with dried chilies and Radish. Sikam Paa is the most famous and most loved dish by the people of Bhutan.</p>
<h4>Hoentay</h4>
<p>Hoentay is a type of dumpling that is popular in Bhutan. Similar to momos they are made from buckwheat dough wrapper usually combined with spinach and cheese.</p>
<h4>Puta</h4>
<p>Puta is a famous dish in Bhutan containing fresh homemade buckwheat noodles. Actually this dish is more typical for the city Bumthang, a very cold district (did you know that buckwheat grows even in very cold climates? This is how the abundant usage of buckwheat in Bhutan could be explained) located in the center of Bhutan, a place with an amazing valley where buckwheat grows plentifully.

    The buckwheat noodles are handmade and then spiced with chili and served with egg and scallions. Puta is also served as a food offering to gods (tshok) and to the priest.
    
    I have adapted the authentic dish to a more affordable one by using Japanese soba noodles which contain buckwheat, because making the noodles from scratch might be a hassle. Still, I got an amazing result and the dish turned out to be extremely delicious.</p>
